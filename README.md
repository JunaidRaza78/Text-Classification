Overview
This project aims to perform text classification using machine learning techniques. Text classification involves categorizing text documents into predefined classes or categories based on their content. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify new, unseen text data into the correct categories.

Dataset
The project utilizes a labeled dataset containing text documents with corresponding class labels. The dataset is preprocessed to prepare the text data for model training and evaluation.

Techniques Used
The following techniques are employed in the project:

Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Feature Extraction (TF-IDF, Word Embeddings, etc.)
Machine Learning Algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, etc.)
Deep Learning (e.g., Recurrent Neural Networks, Transformers, etc.)
Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

data/: Contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
preprocessing/: Includes scripts for data preprocessing and feature extraction.
models/: Contains the trained models and related files.
evaluations/: Includes evaluation metrics and results.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model development.
requirements.txt: Lists the required dependencies for running the project.
